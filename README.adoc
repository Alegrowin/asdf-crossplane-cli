https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane-cli[crossplane-cli] plugin for https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf[asdf] version manager

== Install

```
asdf plugin-add crossplane-cli https://github.com/joke/asdf-crossplance-cli.git
```

== Configuration

=== Customizing the Executable Name

By default, the plugin installs the Crossplane CLI as `crossplane`. You can customize the executable name by setting the `ASDF_CROSSPLANE_EXECUTABLE_NAME` environment variable:

```bash
# Install as 'crossplane' (default)
asdf install crossplane-cli latest

# Install as 'kubectl-crossplane' for backward compatibility
export ASDF_CROSSPLANE_EXECUTABLE_NAME=kubectl-crossplane
asdf install crossplane-cli latest

# Or set it inline
ASDF_CROSSPLANE_EXECUTABLE_NAME=kubectl-crossplane asdf install crossplane-cli latest
```

This is useful for backward compatibility if you have scripts or tools that expect a different executable name.
